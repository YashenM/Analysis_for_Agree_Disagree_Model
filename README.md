# Analysis_for_Agree_Disagree_Model
This thesis develops a mathematical model using ODEs to analyze public opinion dynamics among Ignorant (I), Agree (A), Disagree (D) populations. It simulates shifts in opinion using Euler's method, offering insights into campaign strategies and societal influences. The model aids in predicting electoral outcomes and refining political strategies.
